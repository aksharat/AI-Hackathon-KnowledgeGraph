# Urban Planner & Relocation Assistant

This project was created during the Devpost Hackathon as a proof of concept for an **AI-driven Urban Planner and Relocation Assistant**. It utilizes **Go** for backend processing, integrates with **Neo4j** as a graph database, and plans to incorporate **LLM functionality** for enhanced user interactions.

## Project Overview

The Urban Planner & Relocation Assistant aims to help users make informed decisions about relocation by providing personalized recommendations based on various urban factors.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Created sample datasets for **four zones** with diverse features like population density, transportation, amenities, and cost of living.
2. **Database Integration**:
   - Connected the backend to a **Neo4j graph database** for storing and retrieving data.
   - Designed queries to fetch user-specific insights and suggestions.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - Implemented a system to accept user queries and provide relevant results based on the graph database.

## How It Works
1. Input data about the userâ€™s preferences and requirements.
2. Backend processes the query using Neo4j and retrieves relevant insights.
3. In future iterations, leverage LLMs to refine recommendations and handle complex queries.

## Next Steps
- **LLM Integration**:
  - Enhance the system with **Large Language Model (LLM)** functionality to process natural language queries and generate detailed, personalized insights.
- **Feature Expansion**:
  - Add more granular data points, such as environmental factors, accessibility scores, and housing options.
- **Real-World Application**:
  - Build an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Go
- **Database**: Neo4j
- **Future Enhancements**: Integration with LLMs
